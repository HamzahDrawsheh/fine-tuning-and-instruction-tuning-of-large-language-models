# NLP Assignment 3 – Large Language Models (LLMs)

This project demonstrates the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for Natural Language Processing tasks using pretrained transformer models.

## Objective
To understand how modern LLMs work and how they can be applied to NLP tasks such as text processing and generation with minimal setup.

## Key Concepts
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Transformer architecture
- Tokenization
- Model inference
- Pretrained NLP pipelines

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- NumPy

## Workflow
1. Load a pretrained LLM
2. Tokenize input text
3. Perform inference using the model
4. Analyze and interpret the outputs

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets
